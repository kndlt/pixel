### Memory System
- **User Profiles**: Stored in localStorage with unique IDs
- **Shared Context**: Global conversation summaries accessible to all users
- **Conversation History**: Recent messages for context continuity
- **Migration Ready**: Designed for easy transition to server-side storage

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the server**: `pnpm dev`
2. **Open browser**: Visit `http://localhost:3000`
3. **First interaction**: Pixel welcomes new users and generates unique ID
4. **Chat naturally**: Type in the terminal-style input at bottom
5. **Experience magic**: Watch particles respond to conversation state
6. **Return visits**: Pixel remembers you and previous conversations

## 🔮 Pixel's Behavior

### Personality Traits
- **Welcoming but Mysterious**: Greets new users with mystical language
- **Memory-Driven**: References past conversations and other users
- **Contextually Aware**: Understands it's speaking with different people
- **Playfully Prickly**: Uses wit and forest metaphors
- **Supportive**: Genuinely helpful despite mystical demeanor

### Response Patterns
- Uses mystical emojis sparingly (✨🌙🍃🔮)
- References "the digital forest" and "woodland spirits"
- Calls users "wanderers" or "travelers"
- Builds on shared community context
- Maintains conversation continuity across sessions

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience
