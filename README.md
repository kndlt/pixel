> AI Fairy of Sprited

On my journey to making things happen at Sprited, I will be working closely with AI agents—for advice, collaboration, and plenty of back-and-forth. I thought it’d be fun to give a name to this artificial being. It will be first entity alongside me on this journey with Sprited.

AI’s name is going to be Pixel. Pixel is an artificial entity that will serve as a virtual co-founder.

Right now, most of Pixel’s identity is under wraps. We don’t know their gender; we don’t know how it looks like or sounds like—it’s more fun that way.
